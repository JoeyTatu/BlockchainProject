Been working on Blockchain Labs before creating this repo. Just in case one thought I hadn't done anything beforehand.

The Blockchain Labs repo can be found here: [github.com/JoeyTatu/BlockchainLabs](https://github.com/JoeyTatu/BlockchainLabs)

## Creating an Ethereum account ##

MetaMask has been used to create an Ethereum address. 


## Creating the Token ##

Compile and deploy the ```openzep_contract.sol ``` file in https://remix.ethereum.org/

Verify and public the token on Etherscan.
